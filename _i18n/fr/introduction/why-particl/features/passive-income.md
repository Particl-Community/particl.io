## Passive Income

The Particl platform uses [Particl Proof-of-Stake](https://particl.wiki/learn/staking "Proof Of Stake"), its own native PoS protocol massively improved upon PoS3 on which were added cold staking, quantum-resistance, voting and more. Stakers, the Particl equivalent for miners, can earn a minimum of 4% yearly staking interest (during the second year) in exchange for securing the network with their coins. On top of these staking rewards, stakers earn all fees and revenue generated by the platform (marketplace, decentralized applications, transactions, messaging, etc.) which means staking becomes increasingly profitable as more people participate in the Particl economy. Other ways to earn money on the Particl platform include setting up a shop on the Particl marketplace or using any other Dapp on which revenue can be generated.
