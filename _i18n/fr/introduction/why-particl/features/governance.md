## Community Governance

The Particl platform is [governed exclusively by its community]({{site.baseurl}}/proposals/ "Particl community Proposals") and no central authority, including the Particl Foundation and developing team, possess any kind of decisional power as it relates to activities happening within the platform. Particl's marketplace does not have any rule on what can be listed, it is instead being moderated entirely by the stakers who need to flag inappropriate content. Particl takes the power back into people's hands!
