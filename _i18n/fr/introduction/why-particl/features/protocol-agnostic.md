## Protocol-agnostic

As technology evolves at an exponential rate, platforms need to be built with extensibility in mind so that they can survive the test of time. Particl was built from scratch with that very thought in mind. In fact, the Particl platform is designed so that any new, more efficient Data Storage Network (SMSG, IPFS, etc) can be easily integrated, configured by users and used by any decentralized application like the Particl marketplace for storage purposes. Furthermore, being built and always updated to the latest Bitcoin Core codebase, integrating any breakthrough within the Bitcoin ecosystem is made trivial.
