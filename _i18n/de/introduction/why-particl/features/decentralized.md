## Decentralized

The Particl economy is one that is decentralized, private and democratic. We believe many sectors can be improved and rendered more efficient by being designed in a decentralized fashion. Fees can be enormely reduced and no trust to central authority or party is required, making activities within the platform more cost-efficient, private and secure. Furthermore, the platform's resilience to attacks is greatly improved as the only way to shut it down is to shut down the internet completely.
