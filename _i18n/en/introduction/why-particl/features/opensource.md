## Open-Source

Following the lead of Bitcoin, Particl advocates for an [open source](https://github.com/particl "Visit our GitHub") policy. Open source projects have positive effects when it comes to sustainability as it embraces and celebrates principles of open exchange, collaborative participation, peer-reviewing, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community-oriented development. This aspect of the protocol gives users and programmers the ability to inspect, modify and enhance the source code, and finally build on top of it.
