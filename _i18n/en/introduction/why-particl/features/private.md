## Private by Design

Particl's decentralized marketplace is completely private by design, meaning that no transaction can be tracked back to a user. This approach is prefered as the behavior of a blockchain is to record all transactions for ever, opening up a lot of opportunities for third-parties to abuse that data. The various attacks aimed at personal data such as its collection for commercial purposes, theft or surveillance are thwarted by Particl's many privacy protocols.
